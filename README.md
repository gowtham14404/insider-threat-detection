## 🎯 What This Project Does

This system creates a **"Computational DNA"** profile for each user — learning *how* they use their computer, not *what* they do. It then uses two AI models to detect when someone's behavior suddenly changes, which can indicate:

- 🔑 **Account takeover** — someone else using stolen credentials
- 😤 **Disgruntled employee** — erratic behavior before a data leak
- 🕵️ **Lateral movement** — attacker moving through the network
- 📤 **Data exfiltration** — unusual file access + network activity

## 🧠 AI Models Explained

### Model 1: One-Class SVM (Fast Scoring)
```python
OneClassSVM(kernel='rbf', nu=0.08, gamma='scale')
```
- **What it does:** Learns the boundary of "normal" behavior
- **Speed:** Scores in <1ms per sample
- **Best for:** Catching sudden, obvious anomalies
- **Limitation:** No memory — treats each snapshot independently

### Model 2: LSTM Autoencoder (Deep Scoring)
```
Input Sequence → Encoder LSTM → Bottleneck (8 units) → Decoder LSTM → Reconstructed Sequence
                                      ↓
                           If reconstruction error HIGH → ANOMALY
```
- **What it does:** Learns the *sequence* of normal behavior over time
- **Speed:** Scores in ~5ms per sequence
- **Best for:** Catching subtle, gradual behavioral drift
- **Advantage:** Understands that "normal" is a sequence, not a snapshot

### Ensemble Scoring
```
Final Score = OCSVM(45%) + LSTM(55%)

Per modality:
  Keystroke  → 30% weight
  Mouse      → 20% weight  
  System     → 50% weight  ← Most reliable signal

Alert Levels:
  0.00 - 0.35  =  ✅ BASELINE    (normal)
  0.35 - 0.52  =  👀 WATCH       (log silently)
  0.52 - 0.72  =  ⚠️  SUSPICIOUS  (SOC review)
  0.72 - 1.00  =  🚨 CRITICAL    (immediate response)
```

| Curvature Index | Path efficiency metric | ✅ Safe |

### 💻 System Behavior
| Feature | Risk Weight | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Normal processes | Low | Baseline comparison |
| PowerShell / CMD | Medium | Recon indicator |

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

```
What NEVER gets stored:
  ❌ Actual keystrokes (passwords, messages, documents)
  ❌ Screen coordinates (where your cursor was)
  ❌ File contents (what was in the files you opened)
  ❌ Network packet contents

What DOES get stored:
  ✅ Timing numbers (e.g., "key held for 95ms")
  ✅ Velocity numbers (e.g., "mouse moved at 350px/s")
  ✅ Process names (e.g., "chrome.exe was running")
  ✅ File extensions (e.g., ".xlsx was accessed")
```

**Compliance:** Designed with GDPR Article 25 (Privacy by Design) principles. 90-day automatic data retention enforcement.

## 🎭 Demo Scenarios

The simulator creates 3 users with different behavioral profiles:

```
alice_normal      → Always behaves normally
                    Expected: ✅ BASELINE (0.10 - 0.30)

bob_suspicious    → Starts normal, gradually drifts over 3 minutes
                    Expected: 👀 WATCH → ⚠️ SUSPICIOUS (0.35 - 0.65)

carol_critical    → Normal for 2 minutes to build baseline,
                    then SUDDENLY runs nmap + data exfil tools
                    Expected: ✅ BASELINE → 🚨 CRITICAL (0.75+)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Tune Alert Thresholds (`server/main.py`)
```python
ALERT_LEVELS = [
    ('CRITICAL',   0.72),   # Lower = more sensitive
    ('SUSPICIOUS', 0.52),
    ('WATCH',      0.35),
    ('BASELINE',   0.0),
]
```

### Tune Modality Weights
```python
MODALITY_WEIGHTS = {
    'ks':  0.30,   # Keystroke importance
    'mc':  0.20,   # Mouse importance
    'sys': 0.50,   # System process importance
}
```

### Change User ID (`agent/collector.py`)
```python
USER_ID = "john_doe"   # Change per machine
SERVER_URL = "http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080"
```

## 🏢 Real-World Use Cases

1. **Enterprise SOC** — Monitor 100s of employees, get alerted when someone accesses sensitive files in unusual ways
2. **MSSP (Managed Security)** — Offer behavioral analytics as a service to clients
3. **Privileged Access Monitoring** — Extra scrutiny on admin/root accounts
4. **Insider Threat Programs** — HR + Security collaboration tool
5. **Zero Trust Architecture** — Continuous authentication based on behavior
6. **Compliance** — HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS behavioral monitoring requirements
7. **Forensics** — Post-incident timeline reconstruction from behavioral logs

## ⚠️ Ethical Guidelines

This system is designed for **authorized enterprise monitoring** with:
- ✅ Employee notification and consent
- ✅ HR and Legal oversight
- ✅ Data minimization (no content capture)
- ✅ Anomaly scoring only (no surveillance)
- ✅ Right to explanation for flagged users

**Never deploy without proper legal authorization and employee disclosure.**
